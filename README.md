# KeyLogger-Software
The keylogger captures and logs every keystroke typed by the user. In addition to logging keystrokes, the system periodically captures screenshots of the userâ€™s screen. These logs and screenshots are then sent to a remote server or storage, specifically through email or a Telegram bot, depending on the user's configuration.
